## Server settings

Server settings are hidden. You need to create your own server settings json for your own server. Server settings must follow the following format:

{
    "email":{
        "email": "example@gmail.com",
        "password": "********"
    }
}

## How to Run locally
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## How to Run unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## How to Run end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
